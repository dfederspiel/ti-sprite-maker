## Usage

Clone and run the following:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Access the app in your browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Click on a square to toggle it on or off. This will automatically update the hex value in the `CALL CHAR` command above the tile. A copy of the current matrix is kept in local storage.

## About
My first taste of programming came on a handâ€‘meâ€‘down TIâ€‘99/4Aâ€”far from stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art even in its day. What caught my eye werenâ€™t the games, but the TIâ€‘Basic manuals tucked inside the box.

Armed with nothing but curiosity (and a stack of graph paper), I spent a summer painstakingly sketching 16Ã—16 sprites, converting each row of pixels into 4â€‘bit binary, then into hexâ€¦ one character at a time. It was tedious, it was thrillingâ€”and it hooked me for good.

Fast forward to today: modern tools have made pixel art as simple as a click, but I still love that oldâ€‘school challenge. TIâ€‘Spriteâ€‘Maker is my tribute to those early days. Instead of graph paper, drag your pixels on screen; instead of manual conversions, get your hex map in an instantâ€”no erasers needed.

This was a fun weekend throwback, and while I donâ€™t plan on writing much TIâ€‘Basic from here on, revisiting that era reminded me how far weâ€™ve come. ðŸš€

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
